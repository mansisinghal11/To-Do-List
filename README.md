# To-Do-List
This website creates a to do list for you, just add new tasks you want to do in a day by clicking the '+' button and you can also delete them by clicking on the checkbox once you are done with a particular task.
Also you can make seperate lists related to different areas like, shopping, school, work and many more by just adding /[List Heading] (Eg: add /shopping after the link for making a todolist related to shopping).

This website is made using EJS, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and is deployed on heroku.com. The database of this website is linked through mongodb.
